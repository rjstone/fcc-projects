        <strong>Phra Ajahn ("Venerable Teacher") Mun Bhuridatta Mahathera ("Great Elder")</strong>, 1870-1949, was a Thai
        <em>bhikkhu</em> (Buddhist Monk) of Lao descent who is credited with co-founding the extremely influential
        reformist
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thai_Forest_Tradition">Thai Forest Tradition</a> along with his
        mentor
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ajahn_Sao_Kantas%C4%ABlo">Phra Ajahn Sao KantasÄ«lo Mahathera</a>.
        Feeling that the customary Buddhist practices in Thailand at the time had little to offer, he joined the
        reformist
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dhammayut">Dhammayut</a> order taking Ajahn Sao (a student of
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mongkut">Prince Monkut</a> who was a Dhammayut monk for twenty-seven
        years before ascending to the Thai throne as Rama IV) as his preceptor.[1][2] His influence on Buddhism
        in Thailad and beyond is difficult to quantify yet even more difficult to overstate.
      </p>

      <p>Major events in Ajahn Mun's life and beyond: [3]</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>1870</strong> &mdash; Born Mun Kaenkaew the son of rice farmers in Baan Kham Bong, a farming village
          in Ubon Ratchathani Province, Isan.</li>
        <li>
          <strong>1892</strong> &mdash; Ordained as a monk at Wat (monastery) Liap at the age of 22 as Bhurridatta Bhikkhu.</li>
        <li>
          <strong>1893</strong> (estimated) &mdash; Experiences a dream
          <em>nimatta</em> (sign) convincing him that Buddhist enlightenment is still possible. This had a profound
          influence on the rest of his life causing his meditation practice to become very disciplined and determined.</li>
        <li>
          <strong>1894-1927</strong> &mdash; Spends the major part of his life wandering through Thailand, Burma, and Laos
          engaging in solitary practice and teaching both monks and laypeople. During this time he attracts a significant
          following.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>1928</strong> &mdash; He and his followers are ordered by authorities to settle down in Thai monasteries
          to help propagate official religious reforms. He and some of his students relocate to northern Thailand
          but continue their forest practice.</li>
        <li>
          <strong>1929-1940</strong> &mdash; Stays at Wat Chedi Luang in Chiengmai for a very short time, but almost immediately
          leaves the wat and his followers to devote himself almost exclusively to seculded forest practice. His
          followers believe he attained Buddhist Enlightenment during this time. The whole time Ajahn Mun ignores
          official invitations to settle in a monastery.</li>
        <li>
          <strong>1940</strong> &mdash; Phra Chao Khun Dhammacetiya of Wat Bodhi Somphorn visits Ajahn Mun in the woods
          and finally convinces him to take up residence in a monastery.</li>
        <li>
          <strong>1942</strong> &mdash; Attends the funeral of his former mentor Ajahn Sao.</li>
        <li>
          <strong>1949</strong> &mdash; Passed away at Wat Suddhavasa, Sakon Nakhon Province.</li>
        <li>
          <strong>1950s</strong> &mdash; The Thai Forest Tradition gains wide acceptance in Bankok.</li>
        <li>
          <strong>1970s</strong> &mdash; The Thai Forest Tradition gains wide acceptance on a national level in Thailand
          and begins to spread to other countries, including Western countries, where it eventually has a profound
          effect on the study of psychology. <a href="http://www.ajahnchah.org/">Ajahn Chah</a> is perhaps his
          most well-known disciple in Western countries.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>Ajahn Mun was an extremely solitary, publicity-avoding individual living in remote areas of Thailand with
        primitive technology. As a result, few transcriptions and no recordings of his teaching are available.
        Considering this, the propagation of his profound influence on Buddhism, and indirect influence on modern
        psychology, has been nothing short of miraculous.</p>

      <blockquote>Once we see through inconstancy, the mind-source stops creating issues. All that remains is the primal mind,
        true and unchanging. Knowing the mind-source brings release from all worry and error. If you go out
        to the mind-ends, you're immediately wrong.</blockquote>
